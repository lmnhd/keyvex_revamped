**ALWAYS create a git checkpoint before significant changes
**ALWAYS use strongly typed objects or Classes
**NEVER use generic 'any' types EVER! - This is TYPESCRIPT!
**NEVER create 'Fallback' solutions to avoid throwing erros!
**ALWAYS deal with the core issue - not how to compensate with 'mock' scenarios!
**NEVER write 'MOCK' implementations or code unless specifically asked to! - simply use 'Not-Implemented' when necessary.
**ALWAYS take an AI FIRST approach! - avoid programattic solutions when AI can do it!
**NEVER start/stop/manage the Next.js dev server
**NEVER remove TODO comments
**ALWAYS separate core business logic from Next.js API route handlers**  (i.e. api/<endpoint>/core-logic.ts)
**ALWAYS use strongly typed objects or Classes
**ALWAYS keep file lengths less than 500 lines - break into multiple files if necessary
